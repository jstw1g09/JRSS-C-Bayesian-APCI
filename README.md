## *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C*

## Data

The data chosen for illustrative purposes in this paper are the female death data and the corresponding exposures for England and Wales, extracted from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). They are classified by single year of age from 0 to 99, and years ranging from 1961 to 2002.

These data were extracted from the following resources available in the public domain: https://www.mortality.org/

## Code

The code for the MCMC algorithms, simulations studies, and various computations, presented in the paper has been written in R. This is stored in the file "Bayesian_model_compare_MF_Rcode_final.R".
